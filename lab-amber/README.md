# Amber Kim CodeFellows Lab 09 Persistence with File System

## Introduction
This is a simple node.js app with an Http Server that implements Restful API's. It is built using Vanilla JavaScript and practices separation of concerns. Some peristence is created using NPM File Server.

## To Run This Application
Run server.js. Some example tools and commands you can use:
```
node index.js
// for node

npm run start
// the package.json in this repo is configured to run "nod index.js" with this command.
```

NOTES: DO NOT use Nodemon to run the index.js file as it will cause an infinite loop.

RECOMMENDED: Test this app by using an http client like Postman.

### For Getting all the Projects:

    "description": "The Arithmetic.add method expects two integers as parameters and returns either null if the entered arguments are invalid or an integer as the sum of both numbers.",
    "link": "https://github.com/amgranad/01-node-ecosystem/tree/master/lab-amber"
}
